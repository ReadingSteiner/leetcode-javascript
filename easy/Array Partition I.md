# Array Partition I

## Descriptions: 
Given an array ofÂ 2nÂ integers, your task is to group these integers intoÂ nÂ pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Input:
``` 
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```

**Note:**â€¨
1.	nÂ is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2.	All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].




## My Solution
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var arrayPairSum = function(nums) {
    return nums
            .sort((a,b) => {return a - b})
            .filter((v,i) => {return i % 2 === 0})
            .reduce((prev,next) => {return prev + next}, 0)
};
```

## Best SolutionðŸŽ†
```javascript
var arrayPairSum = function(nums) {
    return nums
            .sort((a,b) => {return a - b})
            .reduce((prev,next,i) => {
                if(i % 2 === 0) {
                    return prev + next
                }else {
                    return prev
                }
            }, 0)
};
```

## Comments
- I think my solution looks really easy to read and understand, but it has more time complexity.
- I don't think the best solution is better, this is just a trade-off between time complexity & readability.
